One of the potential problems with a dynamically typed language, such as JavaScript is working with booleans. Sometimes a boolean value is `1`, `"1"` or `true`, even a string like `"hello"` could be true!  

I always suggest to compare values using `===` instead of `==` as there is a minor difference between them.  

`===` checks that the value matches, but also that the type matches.  
`==` checks the value, but not the type.  

However, when working with external data, such as from an API, you could sometimes receive `true` as a value, or `1`, `"1"`, etc.  

## Let's get to the point.  

When using `! // negation operator` the type returned is boolean. So a trick to easily switch any value to an actual boolean is to negate it!
Here's an example.  
  
```
const isTruthy = !0  
const isFalsy = !1  
```
Another way which could be easier to reason is to use a double negation operator `!!`.  
```
const isTruthy = !!1 
const isFalsy = !!0 
```
Let's hope that the next API you work with gives you real boolean values so you won't have to use this.
